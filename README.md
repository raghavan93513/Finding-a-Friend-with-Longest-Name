# Finding-a-Friend-with-Longest-Name
Write an algorithm and the subsequent Python program to store the names of your friends, count the number of friends, identify the longest name and the number of letters in the longest name. Get the names of friends till 'Stop' is entered. For example, if the input sequence is Ravi, Raj, Puela, Stop,  then the output is 3, Puela and 5.  When you are coding in the online judge (SkillRack), use rstrip() function to remove carriage return from the input string.  Note: First letter of Stop should be in Upper Case
